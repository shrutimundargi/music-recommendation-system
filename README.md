# music-recommendation-system

## Introduction

### Background:

It might be overwhelming to decide what to play next in the modern world where streaming music has become so simple and there are millions and millions of songs available to listen to. Users may find it difficult and time-consuming to find new tracks that suit their tastes. It is also probable that the user would wind up merely choosing what to play next rather than really listening to any songs when there are millions of alternatives available in a genre, which could be frustrating. Systems that generate recommendations make this work incredibly simple.

### Motivation:

Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze and propose music based on a variety of characteristics, including user listening habits and tastes. Music recommendation systems can offer personalized suggestions that are appropriate for the user's musical preferences and can simplify things for users by giving them an easy way to find new artists and genres they might enjoy. It can help consumers discover musical genres they might like and improve their overall listening experience.

### Goal:

Our goal is to create a highly effective music recommendation system by utilizing the extensive Spotify dataset. We intend to collect pertinent music metadata, including information on the song's tempo, danceability, popularity, and year of release. This information will be used to develop a sophisticated recommendation engine that may provide people with a unique and satisfying musical experience. Our technology will propose similar tracks that are probably going to appeal to the user's likes by assessing these components and comparing them to the user's previously listened music. Through this strategy, we hope to help customers expand their musical horizons and improve their overall music-listening experience.
